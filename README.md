ðŸŒ¾ Crop Disease Detection Using Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to detect diseases in crops from images. It focuses on a binary classification taskâ€”whether a crop is healthy or diseased.

ðŸ§  Model Details
Algorithm Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Frameworks: Scikit-learn, OpenCV

Preprocessing:

Image resizing

RGB conversion

Normalization

Label encoding with LabelEncoder

Data Split: 80% training / 20% testing

Model Saving: pickle used to save the trained model for future predictions

ðŸŽ¯ Accuracy
The model achieves an accuracy of 76% on the test dataset.

Accuracy may be impacted by:

Shadows or inconsistent lighting in images

Variation in image quality

ðŸ§ª Sample Testing
Two sample images (sample DF.JPG and sample DP.JPG) were used to test the final model, showing its practical application.

ðŸ’» GUI Support
The project includes a GUI created using Python (Tkinter) to:

Upload an image

Detect whether the crop is healthy or diseased using the saved model

Run the GUI:

bash
Copy
Edit
python "Diseases detection GUI.py"
ðŸ“‚ File Structure
main.ipynb - Main training and evaluation notebook

cnn_tourch.ipynb - Alternative deep learning model exploration

svm_model_crop.py - Contains the SVM training logic

Diseases detection GUI.py - GUI application to test the model

sample DF.JPG / sample DP.JPG - Sample testing images

README.md - Project documentation

ðŸ”§ How to Run
Clone the repository or unzip the project.

Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run training or directly use the saved model with the GUI.

ðŸ“Ž Dependencies
